# Agents API Extraction Map

This map classifies Data Machine's current agent/runtime surface for the next Agents API phase. The next phase is not direct slice-by-slice extraction into an external repository. The next phase is an in-repo, core-style `data-machine/agents-api/` module that Data Machine consumes as product code while it still ships in this repository.

Parent issue: [Explore splitting Agents API out of Data Machine](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1561)

Strategy update: [Agents API blocker: update extraction docs around in-repo module strategy](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1640)

Related blockers: [standalone extraction umbrella](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1596), [standalone skeleton plan](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1618), [in-repo module boundary](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1631), [candidate relocation](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1632), [wp-ai-client dependency contract](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1633), and [ai-http-client removal](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1027).

## Current Strategy

Build the Agents API as an in-repo module first:

```text
data-machine/
  agents-api/
    agents-api.php
    inc/
    tests/
  inc/
    ...Data Machine pipelines/product code...
```

Treat `data-machine/agents-api/` like WordPress core substrate while it still lives inside Data Machine:

- `agents-api` must not import Data Machine product namespaces.
- Data Machine may import and consume `agents-api` as product code.
- Data Machine keeps flows, pipelines, jobs, handlers, queues, retention, pending actions, content operations, and admin UI.
- Later standalone extraction means moving the already-bounded module into its own plugin/repo and adding plugin bootstrap, release, dependency, and distribution ceremony.
- `ai-http-client` is not future architecture. It is only packaging precedent for bundled-then-extracted code.
- The future runtime dependency direction is `Data Machine -> agents-api -> wp-ai-client`; `ai-http-client` dies as part of [#1027](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1027) / [#1633](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine/issues/1633).

```text

```

## Target Vocabulary

Mirror the WordPress Abilities API shape instead of importing Data Machine, wpcom, or Automattic AI Framework names into the public contract.

| Current Data Machine surface | Possible Agents API vocabulary | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wp_register_agent()` | `wp_register_agent()` | Same declarative pattern as Abilities API-style registration; no DB reconciliation side effects in the public helper. |
| `WP_Agent` / `WP_Agents_Registry` | `WP_Agent` / `WP_Agents_Registry` | Registry collects definitions. Persistence/adoption remains Data Machine adapter territory. |
| `wp_agents_api_init` | `wp_agents_api_init` | Core-shaped init hook mirrored in-place while Data Machine hosts the substrate. |
| `AgentMessageEnvelope` | `WP_Agent_Message` or same class name | Contract is generic and now uses Agents API-shaped vocabulary in place. |
| `ConversationTranscriptStoreInterface` | `WP_Agent_Conversation_Transcript_Store_Interface` | Transcript CRUD is the first extractable storage contract. Keep chat-product listing/read-state/reporting separate. |
| `AgentMemoryStoreInterface` | `WP_Agent_Memory_Store_Interface` | Generic identity tuple needs naming review; Data Machine scaffolding/abilities stay outside the store contract. |
| `RuntimeToolDeclaration` | `WP_Agent_Tool_Declaration` | Should stay ability-native and run-scoped. |
| `LoopEventSinkInterface` | `WP_Agent_Run_Event_Sink_Interface` | Useful for logs, streaming, chat UIs, and async workers. |
| REST `datamachine/v1` agent routes | REST `wp-agents/v1` | Data Machine product routes stay under `datamachine/v1`. |

## Boundary Rules

Use these checks before moving anything:

- If a plugin can use it without knowing about flows, pipeline steps, handlers, queues, jobs, or Data Machine content operations, it is an Agents API candidate.
- If it translates Data Machine concepts into runtime concepts, it is a Data Machine adapter.
- If it owns flows, jobs, queues, handlers, scheduled automation, retention, admin UI, or content ops, it stays Data Machine product.
- If it uses wpcom or Automattic AI Framework vocabulary directly, treat that code as source material only until normalized behind WordPress-shaped contracts.

## Bucket Summary

| Bucket | Meaning | Current examples |
|---|---|---|
| Agents API public candidate | Generic WordPress-shaped contract or value object. | Message envelopes, transcript store interface, memory store interface, runtime tool declaration validation, agent registration vocabulary. |
| Agents API implementation candidate | Generic implementation, but naming or assumptions need cleanup first. | Built-in loop, request assembly, tool executor, guideline memory store, directive renderer. |
| Data Machine adapter | Glue that turns flows/jobs/pipelines into generic runtime inputs. | `AIStep`, pipeline tool-policy args, transcript persistence policy, adjacent handler tools. |
| Data Machine product | Data Machine automation/product layer. | Jobs, flows, pipelines, handlers, queues, retention, content abilities, admin UI. |
| Intelligence domain | Intelligence plugin concerns, not Data Machine or Agents API. | Wiki, briefings, digests, domain brains. |
| wpcom source material | Useful precedent only. | `\WPCOM\AI\Message`, `\Agent`, `\AgentsStore`, `Conversation_Storage`. |

## Current `Engine\AI` Namespace Split

The current namespace is intentionally mixed while extraction stays in place. Treat `DataMachine\Engine\AI` as a staging namespace, not as an extraction boundary. Grep for the class or subnamespace below before assuming a file is part of the future Agents API runtime.

| Current namespace/surface | Bucket | Boundary decision |
|---|---|---|
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\AgentMessageEnvelope`, `AgentConversationRequest`, `AgentConversationResult`, `AgentConversationRunnerInterface`, `AgentConversationCompletionPolicyInterface`, `AgentConversationTranscriptPersisterInterface`, `LoopEventSinkInterface` | Agents API public candidate | Generic contracts/value objects. `AgentConversationRequest` keeps Data Machine job/flow/pipeline/handler/transcript fields in adapter context rather than the generic runtime payload. These are extraction candidates after vocabulary settles. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\BuiltInAgentConversationRunner`, `AIConversationLoop`, `RequestBuilder`, `WpAiClientAdapter`, `RequestInspector`, `RequestMetadata`, `ConversationManager` | Agents API implementation candidate | Runtime implementation candidates, but still hosted by Data Machine and still carrying compatibility/provider/logging assumptions. Future provider direction is `wp-ai-client`; `ai-http-client` is removal work, not an Agents API runtime layer. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\Tools\RuntimeToolDeclaration`, `Tools\Execution\ToolExecutionCore`, `Tools\ToolSourceRegistry`, `Tools\Policy\ToolPolicyFilter`, `Tools\ToolResultFinder` | Mixed runtime candidate | Generic pieces exist here, but keep source providers and Data Machine decorators out of the public Agents API surface. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\Tools\Sources\DataMachineToolRegistrySource`, `Tools\Sources\AdjacentHandlerToolSource`, `Tools\Policy\DataMachineAgentToolPolicyProvider`, `Tools\Policy\DataMachineMandatoryToolPolicy`, `Tools\Policy\DataMachineToolAccessPolicy`, `Tools\ToolManager`, `Tools\ToolPolicyResolver`, `Tools\ToolParameters` payload merging | Data Machine adapter/product | These translate Data Machine handler, pipeline, queue, permission, persisted-agent, and legacy tool registry concepts into runtime inputs. They stay Data Machine. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\Tools\Global\*` | Data Machine product | Curated product/site-ops tools. Individual capabilities may move to abilities later, but the bundle is not the Agents API registry. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\System\*` and `System\Tasks\*` | Data Machine product | System tasks, task prompts, retention cleanup, and scheduled maintenance stay in Data Machine. A future Agents API may provide a task contract, not these tasks. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\Actions\*` | Data Machine product | Pending-action storage, approval policy, and action-resolution abilities stay Data Machine. Generic approval can be designed later without inheriting these tables/routes. |
| `DataMachine\Engine\AI\Memory\*`, `MemoryFileRegistry`, `SectionRegistry`, `ComposableFileGenerator`, `ComposableFileInvalidation` | Data Machine adapter/product | Memory policy artifacts and file composition are Data Machine's operator/product layer around the generic memory store contract. |
| `PipelineTranscriptPolicy`, `DataMachinePipelineTranscriptPersister`, `DataMachineHandlerCompletionPolicy` | Data Machine adapter | Pipeline/job metadata and adjacent-handler completion are normalized for the runtime through collaborator interfaces, but the implementations stay Data Machine. |

Exit rule for this in-place phase: do not physically move broad namespaces just because they sit under `Engine\AI`. Move only once a class is generic by dependency direction, vocabulary, and tests; otherwise document it as a Data Machine adapter or product surface.

## Agents API Public Candidate

These are closest to generic public contracts. Most should be extracted as contracts/value objects before services.

| Surface | Current location | Why it fits | Target notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AgentMessageEnvelope` | `inc/Engine/AI/AgentMessageEnvelope.php` | JSON-friendly canonical message envelope independent of flows/jobs. | Schema is `agents-api.message`; review whether physical extraction keeps this class name or adopts `WP_Agent_Message`. |
| `AgentConversationResult` | `inc/Engine/AI/AgentConversationResult.php` | Validates result arrays from any runtime runner. | Rename to `WP_Agent_Run_Result` or split into result value object plus validator. |
| `AgentConversationCompletionPolicyInterface` | `inc/Engine/AI/AgentConversationCompletionPolicyInterface.php` | Generic runtime collaborator for deciding whether a tool result completes a run. | Keep Data Machine handler semantics in adapter implementations, not in the loop contract. |
| `AgentConversationTranscriptPersisterInterface` | `inc/Engine/AI/AgentConversationTranscriptPersisterInterface.php` | Generic runtime collaborator for optional transcript persistence. | Future extraction should pair this with the transcript store contract and keep job/flow metadata in Data Machine adapters. |
| `LoopEventSinkInterface` | `inc/Engine/AI/LoopEventSinkInterface.php` | Transport-neutral event sink for logs, streaming, CLI, REST, or chat UIs. | Make event vocabulary public and provider-neutral before extraction. |
| `NullLoopEventSink` | `inc/Engine/AI/NullLoopEventSink.php` | Generic no-op implementation for optional event sinks. | Implementation can move with the interface. |
| `RuntimeToolDeclaration` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/RuntimeToolDeclaration.php` | Validates run-scoped client/runtime tool declarations without Data Machine state. | Rename around `WP_Agent_Tool_Declaration`; keep executor/source/scope vocabulary generic. |
| `AgentMemoryStoreInterface` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryStoreInterface.php` | Generic memory persistence seam using the `agents_api_memory_store` resolver hook. | Rename `AgentMemoryScope` tuple fields only if needed; keep CAS/hash behavior. |
| `AgentMemoryScope` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryScope.php` | Encodes memory identity independently of disk/database implementations. | Review `layer`, `user_id`, `agent_id`, `filename` as the public model. |
| `AgentMemoryReadResult` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryReadResult.php` | Store-neutral read result. | Generic result value object can move unchanged after naming cleanup. |
| `AgentMemoryWriteResult` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryWriteResult.php` | Store-neutral write result with hash/bytes/error shape. | Generic result value object can move unchanged after naming cleanup. |
| `AgentMemoryListEntry` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryListEntry.php` | Store-neutral list entry. | Good candidate if file-backed memory stays in scope. |
| `ConversationTranscriptStoreInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationTranscriptStoreInterface.php` | Transcript CRUD is generic conversation persistence. | First extraction candidate. Rename namespace/vocabulary later; do not require chat UI listing/read-state/reporting for transcript-only backends. |
| `ConversationSessionIndexInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationSessionIndexInterface.php` | Session listing can be generic for UIs, but it is not required for transcript persistence. | Treat as optional until Agents API adopts an identity/listing model. Data Machine chat switcher uses it today. |
| `ConversationReadStateInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationReadStateInterface.php` | Read-state is generic UI behavior, not transcript CRUD. | Optional interface at most. Data Machine chat unread state keeps consuming it. |
| `ConversationRetentionInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationRetentionInterface.php` | Cleanup methods can be backend-generic, but retention policy/scheduling is product behavior. | Data Machine retention tasks stay product; future Agents API may expose only optional backend cleanup. |
| `ConversationReportingInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationReportingInterface.php` | Metrics/reporting reads are useful but product-shaped today. | Optional interface at most. Data Machine daily memory and retention CLI keep consuming it. |
| `ConversationStoreInterface` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationStoreInterface.php` | Aggregate Data Machine chat-product compatibility contract. | Do not extract as the default public contract unless Agents API deliberately wants the full aggregate. Prefer the transcript interface first. |
| `ConversationStoreFactory::get_transcript_store()` | `inc/Core/Database/Chat/ConversationStoreFactory.php` | Narrow resolver for runtime transcript persistence. | Current implementation reuses the Data Machine aggregate filter for compatibility; future Agents API can own a transcript-specific resolver/filter. |
| `datamachine_conversation_store` filter | `ConversationStoreFactory::get()` | Existing Data Machine aggregate store swap seam. | Keep while code lives in Data Machine. A future Agents API filter should not force chat UI/listing/read-state/reporting responsibilities onto transcript-only backends. |
| `agents_api_conversation_runner` filter | `AIConversationLoop::run()` | Runner replacement seam is generic. | Renamed in place from `datamachine_conversation_runner`; do not mirror the old hook under a runtime alias. |
| `datamachine_guideline_updated` action | `GuidelineAgentMemoryStore` | Logical memory/guideline change event is generic. | Target event must not assume Data Machine option names or storage. |
| `wp_register_agent()` helper | `agents-api/inc/register-agents.php` | Declarative agent registration is core-shaped. | Public helper contributes definitions only; persistence reconciliation is not part of the helper contract. |
| `wp_agents_api_init` action | `agents-api/inc/class-wp-agents-registry.php` | Registration collection hook is generic. | Keep as the in-place Agents API-shaped hook while Data Machine hosts the substrate. |
| `datamachine_registered_agent_reconciled` action | `AgentRegistry::reconcile()` | Useful lifecycle event, but current name includes persistence behavior. | Public API should define lifecycle events separately from Data Machine DB reconciliation. |

## Agents API Implementation Candidate

These are plausibly generic implementations, but should not move until naming and Data Machine assumptions are removed.

| Surface | Current location | Why it is not public-ready yet | Extraction direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AIConversationLoop` | `inc/Engine/AI/AIConversationLoop.php` | Name says AI and still carries the compatibility facade/result shape, but handler completion and transcript persistence now route through runtime collaborators. | Keep shrinking the compatibility adapter by extracting provider request assembly and Data Machine logging policy next. |
| `ProviderRequestAssembler` | `inc/Engine/AI/ProviderRequestAssembler.php` | Normalizes messages, tools, model, and caller-selected directives without dispatching, logging, or discovering Data Machine directives. | Good in-place request assembly candidate once prompt/directive vocabulary is settled. |
| `RequestBuilder` | `inc/Engine/AI/RequestBuilder.php` | Data Machine adapter around provider assembly: discovers/directive-policies `datamachine_directives`, emits `datamachine_log`, applies request-size guardrails, and still carries legacy provider-dispatch compatibility. | Keep as Data Machine adapter unless/until the `ai-http-client` / `chubes_ai_request` bridge is removed in favor of `wp-ai-client`. |
| `WpAiClientAdapter` | `inc/Engine/AI/WpAiClientAdapter.php` | Generic bridge to WordPress AI client, but currently lives as Data Machine implementation detail. | Good implementation candidate once request/message contracts are generic. |
| `RequestMetadata` | `inc/Engine/AI/RequestMetadata.php` | Generic inspection/size metadata. | Move after field names are checked against Agents API message/tool vocabulary. |
| `RequestInspector` | `inc/Engine/AI/RequestInspector.php` | Generic debugging/inspection value, likely useful across runtimes. | Rename away from Data Machine only if public debug surface is desired. |
| `PromptBuilder` | `inc/Engine/AI/PromptBuilder.php` | Generic system-message composition engine, but wired to Data Machine directives. | Extract lower-level composer after directive contract is settled. |
| `DirectiveInterface` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/DirectiveInterface.php` | Generic system prompt directive contract. | Rename around guidelines/context providers; remove provider/step_id coupling if too narrow. |
| `DirectiveRenderer` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/DirectiveRenderer.php` | Generic renderer for directive outputs. | Candidate implementation after output shape is stabilized. |
| `DirectiveOutputValidator` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/DirectiveOutputValidator.php` | Generic shape validation. | Candidate implementation after naming cleanup. |
| `DirectivePolicyResolver` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/DirectivePolicyResolver.php` | Generic allow/deny policy idea, current inputs include Data Machine modes/agent config. | Extract after mode and agent policy contracts move. |
| `MemoryFilesReader` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/MemoryFilesReader.php` | Generic memory-to-prompt reader. | Move only after memory registry/store vocabulary is generic. |
| `CoreMemoryFilesDirective` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/CoreMemoryFilesDirective.php` | Generic default memory injection, but file names and layers are Data Machine conventions today. | Needs Agents API memory/guideline convention decision. |
| `AgentModeDirective` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/AgentModeDirective.php` | Generic mode-context directive idea. | Needs generic agent-mode vocabulary or stays Data Machine. |
| `ClientContextDirective` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/ClientContextDirective.php` | Generic client-provided context injection. | Candidate if sanitized context contract is public. |
| `CallerContextDirective` | `inc/Engine/AI/Directives/CallerContextDirective.php` | Generic caller metadata injection. | Candidate if caller context becomes part of Agents API run input. |
| `ConversationManager` | `inc/Engine/AI/ConversationManager.php` | Formats tool call/result messages and conversation artifacts. | Split message formatting helpers from Data Machine transcript details. |
| `ToolExecutor` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolExecutor.php` | Executes ability-native and legacy tools with policy staging. | Extract only the ability-native execution path; leave Data Machine post tracking and pending-action glue behind. |
| `RuntimeToolDeclaration` validators in tests | `tests/runtime-tool-declaration-smoke.php` | Tests generic declaration shape. | Move with the declaration contract. |
| `ToolPolicyFilter` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Policy/ToolPolicyFilter.php` | Generic allow/deny/category/capability filter that takes adapter callbacks for access and mandatory-tool preservation. | Move only with a generic access callback contract; Data Machine permission and handler preservation stay in adapters. |
| `ToolSourceRegistry` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolSourceRegistry.php` | Source-provider composition is generic, but the default providers are Data Machine adapters. | Extract the source registry contract separately from `DataMachineToolRegistrySource` and `AdjacentHandlerToolSource`. |
| `DataMachineToolRegistrySource` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Sources/DataMachineToolRegistrySource.php` | Adapts Data Machine's legacy/product `datamachine_tools` registry into source-provider composition. | Keep in Data Machine; Ability-native tool declarations should inform Agents API instead. |
| `ToolManager` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolManager.php` | Data Machine registry/normalization is based on `datamachine_tools`, legacy class/method tools, handler wrappers, configuration, and UI status. | Keep as Data Machine adapter/product layer; do not make it the public Agents API registry. |
| `ToolParameters` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolParameters.php` | Parameter merge helper is useful, but payload includes job/flow/packet fields. | Keep generic parameter validation; move Data Machine payload merge rules to adapter. |
| `ToolResultFinder` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolResultFinder.php` | Generic enough if it only finds tool result envelopes. | Verify it does not rely on handler result naming before moving. |
| `BaseTool` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/BaseTool.php` | Useful base class for built-in tools, but public API should favor abilities. | Do not make base-tool inheritance the primary Agents API extension point. |
| `GuidelineAgentMemoryStore` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/GuidelineAgentMemoryStore.php` | Generic implementation for `wp_guideline`, but Data Machine does not own that substrate. | Agents API can ship it as optional implementation guarded by `post_type_exists()`. |
| `DiskAgentMemoryStore` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/DiskAgentMemoryStore.php` | Generic self-hosted implementation, but path conventions are Data Machine runtime conventions. | Extract only if Agents API deliberately supports disk memory. |
| `AgentMemoryStoreFactory` | `inc/Core/FilesRepository/AgentMemoryStoreFactory.php` | Generic store resolver pattern. | Rename filter and return type; preserve single resolution point. |
| `WP_Agent` / `WP_Agents_Registry` / `AgentRegistry` | `agents-api/inc/class-wp-agent.php`, `agents-api/inc/class-wp-agents-registry.php`, `inc/Engine/Agents/AgentRegistry.php` | Generic declarative registry now has WordPress-shaped facade; Data Machine reconciliation is delegated to `AgentMaterializer`. | Extract facade/registry contract first; keep Data Machine materializer as consumer. |
| `Agents`, `AgentAccess`, `AgentTokens` repositories | `inc/Core/Database/Agents/` | Generic identity/access/token data model, but table names and permissions are Data Machine-owned. | Extract only after deciding whether Agents API owns persistence tables or just contracts. |
| `AgentAbilities`, `AgentTokenAbilities`, `AgentRemoteCallAbilities`, `AgentCallAbilities` | `inc/Abilities/` | Ability shapes are generic candidates, but slugs and permission helpers are Data Machine-specific. | Re-register as `wp-agents/v1`/Agents API abilities after permission model settles. |

## Data Machine Adapter

These should stay in Data Machine as compatibility glue if a generic runtime plugin appears.

| Surface | Current location | Adapter responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `AIStep` | `inc/Core/Steps/AI/AIStep.php` | Converts flow-step config, data packets, queue prompt head, image engine data, adjacent steps, job snapshot, and transcript policy into a runtime run. |
| `PipelineToolPolicyArgs` | `inc/Core/Steps/AI/ToolPolicy/PipelineToolPolicyArgs.php` | Translates `FlowStepConfig` enabled/disabled tool fields into generic resolver args. This is a Data Machine pipeline adapter. |
| `ToolPolicyResolver` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolPolicyResolver.php` | Orchestrates Data Machine source gathering, persisted agent policy lookup, mandatory adjacent-handler preservation, and permission adapters around the generic policy filter. |
| `PipelineTranscriptPolicy` | `inc/Engine/AI/PipelineTranscriptPolicy.php` | Reads flow/pipeline config and site option to decide transcript persistence. Generic runtime receives the normalized decision through `DataMachinePipelineTranscriptPersister`. |
| `ToolSourceRegistry::SOURCE_ADJACENT_HANDLERS` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/ToolSourceRegistry.php` | Data Machine-specific source that exposes publish/upsert handler tools next to AI steps. |
| `ToolSourceRegistry::SOURCE_STATIC_REGISTRY` / `DataMachineToolRegistrySource` | `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Sources/DataMachineToolRegistrySource.php` | Data Machine-specific source that adapts the curated `datamachine_tools` registry into runtime tool resolution. |
| `FlowStepConfig::getAdjacentRequiredHandlerSlugsForAi()` consumers | `AIStep` and tool policy code | Converts pipeline topology into handler completion requirements. |
| `QueueableTrait` prompt consumption in `AIStep` | `inc/Core/Steps/AI/AIStep.php` | Data Machine flow queue semantics (`static`, `drain`, `loop`) feeding a runtime user-message slot. |
| `DataMachinePipelineTranscriptPersister` | `inc/Engine/AI/DataMachinePipelineTranscriptPersister.php` | Adapts a pipeline job run to the transcript store. Generic runtime calls the transcript persister contract and does not own job metadata. |
| `DataMachineHandlerCompletionPolicy` | `inc/Engine/AI/DataMachineHandlerCompletionPolicy.php` | Adapts adjacent-handler completion rules into a runtime completion policy. Generic runtime calls the policy contract and does not own pipeline handler semantics. |
| `SystemAgentServiceProvider` task registration | `inc/Engine/AI/System/SystemAgentServiceProvider.php` | Registers Data Machine system tasks into Data Machine scheduling. The generic runtime may supply a task interface, not these tasks. |
| `AgentCallTask` | `inc/Engine/AI/System/Tasks/AgentCallTask.php` | Bridges scheduled/system tasks into the agent-call primitive. |
| `AgentBundler` and bundle CLI adapters | `inc/Core/Agents/AgentBundler.php`, `inc/Cli/Commands/AgentBundleCommand.php` | Convert Data Machine pipelines/flows into portable agent bundle artifacts. Bundle primitives may split, but flow/pipeline import/export remains adapter/product. |
| `Api\Agents`, `Api\AgentFiles`, `Api\AgentPing` | `inc/Api/` | Current REST routes are Data Machine API shape. They can adapt to future `wp-agents/v1` contracts. |
| `AgentsCommand`, `MemoryCommand` | `inc/Cli/Commands/` | Operator CLI wrapping current Data Machine repositories and abilities. Generic WP-CLI commands should be designed separately. |

## Conversation Storage Boundary

Conversation storage is split in place, but only the narrow transcript surface is ready to treat as a generic Agents API candidate.

| Layer | Current surface | Boundary decision |
|---|---|---|
| Generic transcript CRUD | `ConversationTranscriptStoreInterface`, `ConversationStoreFactory::get_transcript_store()` | Candidate for Agents API ownership. Runtime persistence should depend on this surface when it only needs complete transcript sessions. |
| Data Machine compatibility aggregate | `ConversationStoreInterface`, `ConversationStoreFactory::get()`, `datamachine_conversation_store` | Stays in Data Machine for now so chat UI, REST, CLI, retention, and reporting keep one behavior-preserving resolver. |
| Chat UI/session switcher | `ConversationSessionIndexInterface`, chat REST/abilities/UI callers | Product behavior today. It may become an optional Agents API UI contract later, but transcript-only backends should not implement it by default. |
| Read state | `ConversationReadStateInterface` | Optional UI behavior. Not part of transcript persistence. |
| Retention | `ConversationRetentionInterface`, retention system tasks/CLI | Backend cleanup methods may be generic, but scheduling and retention policy are Data Machine product. |
| Reporting | `ConversationReportingInterface`, daily memory/retention status readers | Product-shaped metrics today. Keep separate from transcript CRUD. |

Do not decide an `agents_session` CPT, wpcom `Conversation_Storage`, or a new Agents API filter name in this in-place clarification. The current goal is only to make the dependency direction obvious: Data Machine chat product consumes transcript persistence; transcript persistence does not require Data Machine chat product behavior.

## Data Machine Product

These should stay in Data Machine. They may consume Agents API later, but should not move into it.

| Surface | Current location | Why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| Flow and pipeline step system | `inc/Core/Steps/**`, `inc/Engine/Actions/**` | This is Data Machine's automation engine. |
| `AIStep` product behavior | `inc/Core/Steps/AI/AIStep.php` | The step is a Data Machine pipeline step even if it calls a generic runner. |
| Fetch, publish, upsert, webhook gate, system task, agent ping step types | `inc/Core/Steps/**`, `inc/Engine/AI/System/**` | Product workflow primitives, not generic agent runtime. |
| Handler registration and handler tools | `datamachine_handlers`, `datamachine_tools` handler callbacks | Data Machine source/destination plugin model. |
| Jobs and parent/child orchestration | `inc/Core/Database/Jobs/**`, job abilities/commands | Data Machine execution tracking. |
| Queue modes and config patch queues | flow queue abilities, `QueueableTrait` | Data Machine scheduling/backfill behavior. |
| Retention tasks | `inc/Engine/AI/System/Tasks/Retention/**`, `RetentionCommand` | Product cleanup for Data Machine tables/files/Action Scheduler state. |
| Content operations | post, taxonomy, block, alt text, meta description, image, link, IndexNow abilities | Data Machine content automation. |
| Pending actions store and approval workflows | `inc/Engine/AI/Actions/**` | Generic approval may exist later, but current implementation is product storage/policy. |
| Admin UI and React pipeline editor | `src/`, `inc/Core/Admin/**` | Data Machine product UI. |
| Global tools for site ops | `WebFetch`, `WordPressPostReader`, analytics/search console/page speed/image tools | Some tools can become abilities, but the curated Data Machine tool bundle is product. |
| Agent memory CLI command behavior | `MemoryCommand` | Product/operator surface; generic API should define contracts first. |

## Intelligence Domain

Data Machine should not absorb Intelligence-specific vocabulary during extraction.

| Surface | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wiki create/read/update/maintain behavior | Intelligence | If exposed through Data Machine today, treat it as a consumer/domain tool, not runtime substrate. |
| Briefings and digests | Intelligence | Domain workflows built on top of runtime and search abilities. |
| Domain brains and generated/shared wikis | Intelligence | Product/domain policy, not Agents API. |
| Intelligence memory policy additions | Intelligence | May consume generic memory contracts, but policy names and wiki roots stay outside Agents API. |

## wpcom Source Material

These are reference points only. Do not expose them as public Data Machine or Agents API vocabulary.

| Source | How to use it |
|---|---|
| `\WPCOM\AI\Message` | Reference for message object semantics. Normalize behind `WP_Agent_Message` or neutral envelopes. |
| `\Agent` / AI Framework agent classes | Reference for run-loop integration and provider routing. Do not require inheritance from wpcom classes. |
| `\AgentsStore` | Reference for persistence/adoption semantics. Do not leak storage names into public API. |
| `Conversation_Storage` | Reference for compaction/resilience. Keep Data Machine/Agents API conversation store contracts portable and site-owned unless explicitly swapped. |
| Dolly agent architecture | Reference for WordPress-hosted agent UX and memory injection, not a dependency or target vocabulary. |

## Hook Name Map

This map records the in-place hook vocabulary while Data Machine still hosts the
Agents API substrate. Generic runtime seams should use Agents API-shaped names;
Data Machine product and compatibility seams keep Data Machine names.
Hard-cut hook renames assume active cross-repo consumers are updated in lockstep;
this slice's known companion is the Intelligence tier-3 runner adapter update in
Automattic/intelligence#285.

| Previous hook/filter | Current hook/filter | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `datamachine_conversation_runner` | `agents_api_conversation_runner` | Hard-cut rename. Generic runtime replacement seam. |
| `datamachine_tool_sources` | `agents_api_tool_sources` | Hard-cut rename. Generic source-provider composition seam; Data Machine sources remain providers. |
| `datamachine_tool_sources_for_mode` | `agents_api_tool_sources_for_mode` | Hard-cut rename. Generic mode-to-source ordering seam. |
| `datamachine_memory_store` | `agents_api_memory_store` | Already renamed in place; old hook is intentionally not mirrored. |
| `wp_agents_api_init` | `wp_agents_api_init` | Already WordPress-shaped registration hook. |
| `datamachine_conversation_store` | `datamachine_conversation_store` | Keep. This swaps Data Machine's aggregate chat store; a future Agents API transcript hook must be narrower. |
| `datamachine_guideline_updated` | `datamachine_guideline_updated` | Keep for this slice. Event payload and external projection consumers need a narrower Agents API memory-event decision. |
| `datamachine_registered_agent_reconciled` | `datamachine_registered_agent_reconciled` | Keep. This is Data Machine materialization/persistence lifecycle, not pure declarative registration. |
| `datamachine_tools` | `datamachine_tools` | Keep. Legacy/product tool registry; Agents API should prefer ability-native runtime declarations. |

## Hook And Filter Classification

| Hook/filter | Bucket | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agents_api_conversation_runner` | Agents API public candidate | Generic runtime replacement seam. Renamed in place from `datamachine_conversation_runner`. |
| `datamachine_conversation_store` | Data Machine compatibility seam today | Existing aggregate store swap seam. A future Agents API transcript-store filter should be narrower instead of carrying Data Machine chat product responsibilities. |
| `wp_agents_api_init` | Agents API public candidate | Registration hook is now WordPress-shaped in-place; Data Machine still fires the legacy hook while it hosts the substrate. |
| `agents_api_memory_store` | Agents API public candidate | Generic memory persistence swap seam. Renamed in place from `datamachine_memory_store`; do not mirror the old hook under a runtime alias. |
| `datamachine_registered_agent_reconciled` | Agents API implementation candidate | Lifecycle event is useful, current reconciliation semantics are Data Machine implementation. |
| `datamachine_guideline_updated` | Agents API public candidate | Generic memory/guideline change event after naming review. |
| `agents_api_tool_sources` | Agents API implementation candidate | Generic source-provider idea; current defaults include Data Machine adjacent handlers as Data Machine providers. |
| `agents_api_tool_sources_for_mode` | Agents API implementation candidate | Generic mode policy idea; mode names need Agents API contract. |
| `datamachine_tools` | Data Machine product today | Current registry includes legacy Data Machine handler/class shapes. Ability-native subset can inform Agents API. |
| `datamachine_directives` | Agents API implementation candidate | Generic prompt/guideline provider idea, but current directive classes use Data Machine modes. |
| `datamachine_pre_ai_step_check` | Data Machine adapter | Pipeline AI-step skip hook. |
| `datamachine_log` | Data Machine product | Product logging surface. Generic runtime events should use loop event sinks. |
| `chubes_ai_request` | Legacy provider bridge to delete | Legacy `ai-http-client` provider-dispatch filter. Do not carry this into Agents API public vocabulary or architecture; removal belongs to #1027 / #1633. |
| `wp_ai_client` feature detection through `WpAiClientAdapter` | Agents API implementation candidate | WordPress AI client routing is the target provider direction, normalized behind Agents API contracts. |

## Test Coverage Map

These tests currently pin the substrate most relevant to extraction.

| Test | Covers | Extraction signal |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/ai-message-envelope-smoke.php` | Agent message envelope normalization/projection and result validation. | Move with message/result contracts. |
| `tests/agent-conversation-result-smoke.php` | Conversation result shape validation. | Move with runner result contract. |
| `tests/agent-conversation-runtime-policy-smoke.php` | Runtime completion and transcript collaborator seams. | Split generic policy/persister contracts from Data Machine handler/transcript adapter assertions during extraction. |
| `tests/conversation-store-contracts-smoke.php` | Split store interfaces, transcript-only method boundary, and factory return types. | Move transcript CRUD coverage with the generic contract; keep aggregate/product assertions with Data Machine. |
| `tests/guideline-agent-memory-store-smoke.php` | Optional guideline-backed memory implementation. | Move or duplicate if Agents API ships memory store implementations. |
| `tests/daily-memory-store-seam-smoke.php` | Daily memory through memory store seam. | Data Machine product consuming generic memory store. |
| `tests/agent-memory-events-smoke.php` | Memory/guideline change events. | Move event contract after naming review. |
| `tests/memory-bundle-policy-smoke.php` | Bundle-aware self-memory policy. | Mixed: memory contract candidate plus bundle/product policy. |
| `tests/tool-source-registry-smoke.php` | Tool source providers. | Split generic source registry from Data Machine adjacent-handler provider. |
| `tests/tool-executor-ability-native-smoke.php` | Ability-native tool execution. | Good Agents API implementation signal. |
| `tests/runtime-tool-declaration-smoke.php` | Runtime tool declaration validation. | Move with runtime tool declaration contract. |
| `tests/tool-policy-resolver-adjacency-smoke.php` | Pipeline adjacency and handler protection. | Data Machine adapter/product behavior. |
| `tests/pipeline-tool-policy-*.php` | Pipeline tool policy surfaces. | Data Machine adapter tests. |
| `tests/react-pipeline-tool-policy-contract-smoke.php` | React/API contract for pipeline tool policy. | Data Machine product. |
| `tests/system-task-agent-context-smoke.php` | Agent context propagation through system tasks. | Data Machine adapter/product. |
| `tests/agent-call-migration-smoke.php` | Agent-call migration. | Agent-call primitive may inform Agents API; migration stays Data Machine. |
| `tests/agent-bundle-*.php` | Bundle format, artifact store, upgrade planner, portable update. | Split pure manifest/auth/template artifacts from flow/pipeline file adapters. |
| `tests/ai-request-inspector-smoke.php` | Provider request assembly without dispatch plus Data Machine request inspection surface. | Split generic `ProviderRequestAssembler` assertions from Data Machine `RequestBuilder` directive-policy assertions during extraction. |

## First Seams To Make Boring

1. Create `data-machine/agents-api/` as the in-repo module boundary before moving broad code into another repository.
2. Split pipeline policy translation out of `ToolPolicyResolver` so the resolver no longer imports or reads `FlowStepConfig`.
3. Split `AgentRegistry` into a pure registry and a Data Machine reconciler that creates database rows, access rows, directories, and scaffold files.
4. Rename and stabilize message/result/store interfaces in place before moving namespaces.
5. Split provider request assembly from `RequestBuilder` so Data Machine directives/logging stay adapter behavior and provider dispatch targets `wp-ai-client`, not `ai-http-client`.
6. Split `ToolExecutor` into ability-native runtime execution plus Data Machine product hooks for pending actions and post-origin tracking.
7. Decide whether Agents API owns persistence tables or only contracts plus optional stores.
8. Keep wpcom/AI Framework classes behind adapters. No public contract should require `\WPCOM\AI\Message`, `\Agent`, `\AgentsStore`, or `Conversation_Storage`.

## Non-Goals

- Do not move files as part of this map.
- Do not frame the next step as direct external repository extraction; the next code step is the in-repo `data-machine/agents-api/` module.
- Do not rename runtime classes before the target contracts are settled.
- Do not make Data Machine depend on wpcom or Automattic AI Framework vocabulary.
- Do not make Agents API depend on `ai-http-client`; that package is only a packaging precedent and a removal target.
- Do not move Data Machine flows, pipelines, jobs, handlers, queues, retention, content ops, or admin UI into Agents API.
- Do not move Intelligence wiki/briefing/domain-brain vocabulary into Data Machine or Agents API.
